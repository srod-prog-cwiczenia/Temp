 By treating the power set $\mathcal{P}(\N)$ as the space $2^\N$ of all functions $f\colon\N\to 2$ (equipped with the product topology, where each space $2= \left\{0,1\right\}$ carries the discrete topology) and identifying subsets of $\N$ with their characteristic functions, we can talk about descriptive complexity of subsets of $\mathcal{P}(\N)$.
 
+For any partition $\{X_n\}_{n\in\N}$ of $\N$ a set $S\subseteq\N$
+is called a selector of the partition $\{X_n\}_{n\in\N}$ iff
+$\forall_{n\in\N} |X_n \cap S| = 1$.
